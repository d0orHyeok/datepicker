# API

You can access the Snow Datepicker API through the instance of the datepicker.

The instance is returned when you create a new datepicker:

```javascript
const datepicker = new SnowDatepicker('#picker');

datepicker.currentView; // 'days'
datepicker.show();
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

<DocCardList />
